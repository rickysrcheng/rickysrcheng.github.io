This is the final project for ECE 411: Computer Organizations and Design that I took in Spring 2019 at UIUC.
In this project, we built a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor in SystemVerilog, complete with the following:

- Two way set-associative L1 Cache
- Four way set-associative L2 Cache
- Branch Target Buffer
