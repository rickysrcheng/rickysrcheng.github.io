Hello! Welcome to my blog/website. I really like the idea of maintaining a personal space where I can just log my thoughts and learnings
in a single place that's convenient for me to revisit. However, I just never really gotten around to committing to one. I initially started 
using Github pages with the Hugo PaperMod theme. While the theme is good, I felt that it was missing a few features so I didn't really stick 
with it. And then I found the al-folio theme on Jekyll and liked it enough to restart my blog.
